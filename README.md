# Facial_Recognition
Data files for facial recognition and eventually hopefully a working algorithm.
Start by gathering facial images and emotions linked from around the internet. 

Make sure diversity in expression, gender, age, ethnicity is present.
Maybe make an algorithm to find the boundaries of the face first?
